# ðŸš¨ Project Status Notice

**Important:**  
This project currently has a known visual bug caused by viewport restrictions.  
Originally, the application was developed and optimized for a much larger device screen. When viewed on smaller screens, certain layout inconsistencies and responsiveness issues may occur.

ðŸ‘‰ **Action Required:** Please watch the provided demonstration video to experience the project in its fully intended working state.

Additionally, due to the same viewport-related technical constraints, **deployment on [Vercel](https://vercel.com)** is currently **not functioning as expected**.  
Deployment pipelines are impacted until responsive fixes are implemented.

> **Transparency breeds trust â€” this issue is being actively monitored and targeted for upcoming remediation.** âœ…

# ðŸš€ Deploy on Vercel

While [Vercel](https://vercel.com) is typically the recommended platform for Next.js deployments,  
**please note**: due to current viewport-related limitations, deployment on Vercel is **temporarily unstable**.

We recommend local environment exploration until stability patches are deployed.

You may still reference the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for future deployment needs.
