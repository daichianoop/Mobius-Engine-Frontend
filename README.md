# Project Status Notice ðŸš§

**Important:**  
This project currently has a known visual bug caused by viewport restrictions.  
Originally, the application was developed and optimized for a much larger device screen. When viewed on smaller screens, certain layout inconsistencies and responsiveness issues may occur.

ðŸ‘‰ **Action Required:** Please watch the provided demonstration video to view the project in its fully intended working state.

We are actively tracking this issue and anticipate iterative refinements in future sprints to enhance multi-device compatibility.

# Next.js Project Overview

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
